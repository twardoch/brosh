# browser-management

## Core Components (Importance: 85)

1. Platform-Specific Browser Detection
- Chrome/Edge/Safari priority system with OS-dependent availability
- Safari restricted to macOS environments
- Firefox explicitly excluded per business requirements
- Custom detection logic for remote debugging endpoints

2. Debug Mode Connection Management
- Dedicated debug ports per browser:
  - Chromium: 9222
  - Edge: 9223
  - WebKit: 9225
- Progressive connection strategy with fallbacks:
  - Attempt existing browser connection
  - Launch new debug instance if needed
  - Platform-specific cleanup procedures

## Display Management (Importance: 75)

1. Resolution Handling
- OS-specific screen dimension detection
- Special handling for Retina displays (physical resolution รท 2)
- Fallback resolution: 1440x900
- Full-page capture support (height=-1)

2. Zoom Control
- CSS-based zoom implementation vs device scaling
- Custom DOM event listeners for zoom application
- Validation constraints: 10-500% range

## Browser Session Management (Importance: 80)

1. Lifecycle Control
- Aggressive process cleanup before debug launches
- Platform-specific termination procedures
- Session persistence for authenticated captures
- Automatic recovery from disconnections

2. Viewport Management 
- Dynamic viewport resizing based on capture requirements
- Content-aware dimension calculations
- Platform-specific DPI handling
