description: Handles browser lifecycle, connection management, and debugging for web page capture operations including cross-platform browser detection and cleanup
globs: src/brosh/browser.py,src/brosh/capture.py,src/brosh/mcp.py
### Browser Priority and Debug Management
The browser management implements a hierarchical priority system for browser selection and debugging:
1. **Browser Priority Chain**
- Chrome (Priority 1)
- Edge (Priority 2)
- Safari (Priority 3, macOS only)
- Firefox explicitly unsupported
2. **Debug Port Allocation**
- Chromium: 9222
- Edge: 9223
- WebKit: 9225
### Connection Management
The BrowserManager handles browser lifecycle with platform-specific implementations:
1. **Session Initialization**
- Aggressive process cleanup before debug launches
- Platform-specific browser detection and path resolution
- Debug mode connection verification with retry logic
2. **State Management**
- Platform-aware screen dimension detection including Retina support
### Cleanup Procedures
Implements robust cleanup for browser processes:
1. **Pre-Launch Cleanup**
- Force termination of existing debug instances
- Port availability verification
- Platform-specific process enumeration and termination
2. **Post-Capture Cleanup**
- Graceful session termination
- Debug port release
- Orphaned process cleanup

## Core Browser Management Logic (Importance: 95)

### Browser Priority System
- Strictly enforced browser hierarchy: Chrome > Edge > Safari
- Safari restricted to macOS platform only
- Firefox explicitly unsupported
- Each browser type gets dedicated debug ports:
  - Chromium: 9222
  - Edge: 9223
  - WebKit: 9225

### Platform-Specific Detection
Located in `src/brosh/browser.py`:
- OS-specific resolution detection with Retina support
- Browser executable path discovery per platform
- Debug port allocation and validation
- Process cleanup and resource management

## Debug Mode Operations (Importance: 90)

### Connection Management
- Maintains separate debug ports per browser type
- Supports connecting to existing browser sessions
- Debug mode orchestration with state tracking
- Process cleanup on abnormal termination

### Browser Launch Protocol
- Custom launch arguments per browser type
- Remote debugging protocol initialization
- Connection validation and retry logic
- Resource cleanup on launch failures

## Context Controls (Importance: 85)

### Session Management
- Maintains authentication state across captures
- Preserves cookies and extensions
- Handles viewport dimension settings
- Manages browser lifecycle states

### Cleanup Procedures
- Graceful shutdown of browser instances
- Debug port release and validation
- Process termination confirmation
- Resource cleanup verification

### API Interface
Located in `src/brosh/browser.py`:
```python
def launch_browser_and_connect(browser_type: str) -> BrowserContext:
    """Launch browser in debug mode and establish connection"""

def quit_browser(browser_type: str) -> None:
    """Gracefully terminate browser instance"""
```
