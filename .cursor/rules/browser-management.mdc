### Browser Priority and Debug Management

The browser management implements a hierarchical priority system for browser selection and debugging:

1. **Browser Priority Chain**
- Chrome (Priority 1)
- Edge (Priority 2) 
- Safari (Priority 3, macOS only)
- Firefox explicitly unsupported

2. **Debug Port Allocation**
- Chromium: 9222
- Edge: 9223 
- WebKit: 9225

### Connection Management

The BrowserManager handles browser lifecycle with platform-specific implementations:

1. **Session Initialization**
- Aggressive process cleanup before debug launches
- Platform-specific browser detection and path resolution
- Debug mode connection verification with retry logic

2. **State Management** 
- Session persistence for authenticated captures
- Automatic recovery from disconnections
- Platform-aware screen dimension detection including Retina support

### Cleanup Procedures

Implements robust cleanup for browser processes:

1. **Pre-Launch Cleanup**
- Force termination of existing debug instances
- Port availability verification
- Platform-specific process enumeration and termination

2. **Post-Capture Cleanup**
- Graceful session termination
- Debug port release
- Orphaned process cleanup

- `src/brosh/browser.py`: Core browser management implementation
- `src/brosh/capture.py`: Browser state handling during capture
- `src/brosh/mcp.py`: Debug mode coordination for MCP server
