# component-flow

Core component interaction flow for browser screenshot operations:

## Primary Component Flow (Importance: 95)

1. BrowserManager → CaptureManager
- Provides browser context and viewport configuration
- Handles browser lifecycle events and connection status
- Passes viewport dimensions and scroll capabilities

2. CaptureManager → ImageProcessor
- Sends sequential viewport captures during scrolling
- Provides scroll position metadata for frame alignment
- Transmits visible HTML content for section detection

3. ImageProcessor → BrowserManager
- Signals frame capture completion for scroll coordination
- Provides merged image dimensions for viewport updates
- Reports animation frame timing for scroll synchronization

## Error Flow Paths (Importance: 85)

1. Browser Connection Failures
- BrowserManager retries connection with exponential backoff
- Falls back to new browser instance launch
- Notifies CaptureManager of viewport reconfiguration

2. Capture Synchronization
- CaptureManager validates scroll state before captures
- Implements retry logic for failed frame captures
- Maintains capture session state across retries

3. Image Processing Failures 
- ImageProcessor maintains partial results for recovery
- Supports resuming from last successful frame
- Preserves capture metadata during retries

## Async Operation Flow (Importance: 80)

1. Progressive Capture Pipeline
- BrowserManager initiates async browser operation
- CaptureManager orchestrates parallel scroll and capture
- ImageProcessor handles concurrent frame processing

2. State Management
- Components maintain isolated state machines
- Async event coordination via message passing
- Viewport synchronization through state broadcasts
