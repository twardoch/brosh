### Core Component Flow

The component flow between BrowserManager, CaptureManager and ImageProcessor follows a specific sequence to handle webpage capture:

#### Primary Flow
1. BrowserManager detects and initializes browser (Chrome > Edge > Safari)
2. CaptureManager receives capture request with parameters
3. CaptureManager coordinates with BrowserManager for viewport management and scrolling
4. ImageProcessor receives raw captures for optimization and assembly
5. Results flow back through CaptureManager to BrowserManager

#### Async Flow Management
- BrowserManager maintains browser lifecycle asynchronously
- CaptureManager coordinates multiple async capture operations
- ImageProcessor handles frame processing in parallel
- Events coordinate state between components

#### Error Flow
- Browser connection failures trigger retries in BrowserManager
- Capture synchronization errors handled by CaptureManager
- Image processing failures bubble up through ImageProcessor
- Each component implements domain-specific recovery logic

### Key Integration Points

1. BrowserManager → CaptureManager
- Browser instance handoff
- Viewport dimension updates 
- Scroll position coordination

2. CaptureManager → ImageProcessor
- Raw frame delivery
- Capture metadata
- Processing instructions

3. ImageProcessor → CaptureManager
- Processed frames
- Assembly status
- Optimization results

### State Coordination

1. Browser State
- Debug mode status
- Connection health
- Viewport position

2. Capture State  
- Active selectors
- Scroll progress
- Frame sequence

3. Processing State
- Frame assembly progress
- Format conversions
- Optimization status
