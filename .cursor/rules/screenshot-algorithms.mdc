## Viewport Scrolling Algorithm (90/100)
Core screenshot capture logic implemented in `src/brosh/capture.py`:

1. Progressive Viewport Scrolling
- Calculates scroll positions based on viewport height and configurable overlap
- Handles dynamic content loading between scrolls
- Maintains scroll state consistency across captures
- Supports starting capture from specific DOM selectors

2. Section Detection (85/100)
- Analyzes visible headers and ID elements to identify meaningful page sections
- Generates semantic identifiers from visible content
- Implements viewport intersection detection for section boundaries
- Prioritizes selectors using predefined content patterns:
```python
['main', 'article', '[role="main"]', '.content', '#content']
```

3. Content Visibility Analysis (80/100)
- Custom algorithm for detecting fully visible elements in viewport
- Hierarchy-aware filtering to avoid duplicate content capture
- Excludes non-visible structural elements
- Handles partially visible elements at viewport boundaries

## Image Processing (75/100)
Screenshot merging and processing in `src/brosh/image.py`:

1. Frame Assembly
- Merges sequential viewport captures with overlap removal
- Maintains visual consistency across scroll transitions
- Custom APNG creation for scrolling animation
- Handles alpha channel preservation across formats

2. Business Rules
- Scroll step: 10-200% of viewport height
- Zoom range: 10-500%
- Required overlap between consecutive captures
- Section-based frame segmentation

## Key Differentiators
- Semantic section identification for contextual organization
- Intelligent viewport intersection detection
- Dynamic content-aware scrolling algorithm
- Automated section boundary detection
