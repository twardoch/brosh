### Core Screenshot Capture Logic

**Viewport Scrolling Algorithm**
- Progressive viewport scrolling with overlap detection
- Scroll positions calculated using viewport height and configurable overlap (10-200%)
- Dynamic content detection between scroll operations 
- Scroll state maintenance across sequential captures
- Support for starting capture from specific DOM selectors

**Section Detection Engine**
- Semantic section identification using visible headers and ID elements 
- Viewport intersection mapping against content hierarchy
- Generation of contextual section identifiers from visible elements
- Real-time detection of expanding/collapsing content

**Image Processing Pipeline**
- Frame assembly with intelligent overlap removal
- APNG creation with configurable animation timing (0.1-10s per frame)
- Alpha channel preservation across format conversions
- Frame downsampling and optimization for size constraints

**Browser Integration**  
- Browser priority system (Chrome > Edge > Safari)
- Debug port assignments per browser type:
  - Chromium: 9222
  - Edge: 9223 
  - WebKit: 9225
- Platform-specific resolution detection with Retina support
- Dynamic content loading detection and wait states
