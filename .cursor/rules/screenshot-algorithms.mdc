description: Technical specification for browser screenshot capture algorithms including viewport scrolling, section detection, and image merging
globs: src/brosh/capture.py,src/brosh/image.py,src/brosh/browser.py,src/brosh/models.py
### Core Screenshot Capture Logic
**Viewport Scrolling Algorithm**
- Progressive viewport scrolling with overlap detection
- Scroll positions calculated using viewport height and configurable overlap (10-200%)
- Dynamic content detection between scroll operations
- Scroll state maintenance across sequential captures
- Support for starting capture from specific DOM selectors
**Section Detection Engine**
- Semantic section identification using visible headers and ID elements
- Viewport intersection mapping against content hierarchy
- Generation of contextual section identifiers from visible elements
- Real-time detection of expanding/collapsing content
**Image Processing Pipeline**
- Frame assembly with intelligent overlap removal
- APNG creation with configurable animation timing (0.1-10s per frame)
- Alpha channel preservation across format conversions
- Frame downsampling and optimization for size constraints
**Browser Integration**
- Browser priority system (Chrome > Edge > Safari)
- Debug port assignments per browser type:
  - Chromium: 9222
  - Edge: 9223
  - WebKit: 9225
- Platform-specific resolution detection with Retina support
- Dynamic content loading detection and wait states
### Key Components
`src/brosh/capture.py`:
- CaptureManager class implementing scrolling and section detection
- Viewport state management and scroll position calculation
- Dynamic content detection mechanisms
`src/brosh/image.py`:
- ImageProcessor class for frame assembly and optimization
- APNG creation and animation control
- Overlap detection and removal algorithms
`src/brosh/browser.py`:
- BrowserManager handling browser detection and connection
- Debug port management and platform-specific optimizations
- Screen resolution and DPI scaling logic

## Screenshot Capture Core (Importance: 95)

### Semantic Section Detection
Located in `src/brosh/capture.py`:
- Analyzes DOM structure to identify meaningful content blocks
- Maps viewport intersections to semantic sections
- Generates contextual identifiers from visible elements
- Maintains section hierarchy during scrolling

### Viewport Management
Located in `src/brosh/capture.py`:
- Progressive scrolling with overlap constraints (10-200%)
- Dynamic height adjustment for expanding content
- Section boundary detection during viewport movement
- Content-aware scroll step calculation

### Image Processing Pipeline
Located in `src/brosh/image.py`:
- Merges overlapping screenshots into seamless output
- Handles animated PNG creation for scrolling animations
- Section-aware naming for captured frames
- Viewport masking for clean section boundaries

## Content Processing Engine (Importance: 85)

### HTML Analysis
Located in `src/brosh/texthtml.py`:
- Extracts visible DOM content per viewport
- Maps elements to semantic sections
- Generates Markdown from visible text
- Detects dynamic content changes

### Scroll Behavior
Located in `src/brosh/capture.py`:
- Smart scroll step calculation based on content
- Section-aware viewport positioning
- Overlap detection between captures
- Dynamic content stabilization delays

### Viewport Processing
Located in `src/brosh/capture.py`:
- Content-based viewport height adjustment
- Semantic section boundary detection
- Progressive capture state tracking
- Overlap validation between frames

Core Business Rules:
- Viewport overlap must be between 10-200%
- Dynamic content requires stabilization delay
- Section boundaries determine frame splits
- Seamless merging requires pixel-perfect alignment
- Content changes invalidate previous captures
