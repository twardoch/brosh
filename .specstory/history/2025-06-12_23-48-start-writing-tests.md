I'll help you start writing tests for your brosh project. Let me first examine the current test structure and the main code to understand what needs to be tested. Now let me examine the main modules to understand the structure and functionality: Let me continue reading the API and check the CLI module: Now let me check the `pyproject.toml` for test dependencies: Let me check for more test dependencies and see what testing structure is expected: Now let me also check if there are any existing test configurations: Let me check the current mcp.py file since that was the current file the user was in: Perfect! Now I have a good understanding of the brosh project structure. Let me create comprehensive tests for this browser screenshot tool. I'll start by creating a proper test structure with multiple test files covering different aspects of the code. Let me fix the linting errors: 
```

```

```

```
Now let me create tests for the models module: Let me fix the linting issues: 
```

```
I need to check the actual model definitions to understand the correct structure. Let me read the full models file: Let me also check for CaptureResult: Now I need to fix the test to match the actual model structure. Let me also check the long line issues: 
```

```
Let me fix the remaining validation test and the model test issues: 
```

```
Let me fix all the remaining validation errors and model issues: 
```

```
Now let me fix the remaining model tests by replacing them with the correct model structure: 
```

```
Let me fix the remaining MCP model tests: 
```

```

```

```
Now let me create tests for the API module: Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.
