# TODO.md

- Analyze `PLAN.md` and then update `CHANGELOG.md` with the changes performed. Remove the things that are done from `PLAN.md`
- Run `./cleanup.sh` 
- Analyze the response and replace `PLAN.md` with a new plan to fix the issues. 
- Analyze `llms.txt` (which is the entire codebase). 
- Update `README.md`. This is extremely important. REMOVE all content that no longer is correct or relevant. ADD new content that is correct and relevant (to the recent changes or to the whole codebase). 

Be resilient. Be autonomous. Be creative. Be efficient. Be effective. Be concise. Be clear. Be precise. Be correct. Be complete.
